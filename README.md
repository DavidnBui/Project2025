# ** Project Idea **

Create visualizations based on sales data to identify key trends, patterns, and insights. This project will involve cleaning and analyzing sales datasets, then building interactive dashboards or static charts to communicate findings clearly. Visualizations may include metrics like monthly revenue, top-selling products, regional performance, customer segmentation, and seasonal trends. The goal is to provide actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making for sales and marketing strategies.
